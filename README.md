# Multi-Level Password Generator
Python Programming 
### Overview
This project is a password generator that allows users to create secure passwords based on specific criteria. It includes multiple options for generating passwords, such as using only numbers, letters, symbols, or combinations of all. The application also provides detailed instructions for creating strong and secure passwords.
### Features
•	Generate passwords of varying types and lengths. <br>
•	Support for passwords that use: <br>
o	Numbers only<br>
o	Letters only<br>
o	Symbols only<br>
o	Combinations of numbers, letters, and symbols<br>
•	Input validation to ensure the password length is between 8 to 16 characters. <br>
•	Clear and user-friendly instructions explaining the strength of different password types. <br>
•	Customizable password types based on user preference. <br>
### Python Concepts Used<br>
•	Random Module: Used to generate random characters from different sets (numbers, letters, and symbols). <br>
•	String Module: For accessing predefined character sets such as ASCII letters, digits, and punctuation marks. <br>
•	List & String Operations: To store and manipulate password characters. <br>
•	Input Validation: Ensures the user provides valid input for password length and type. <br>
•	While Loops: Used for repeated prompts until valid input is given. <br>
•	Conditional Statements: To determine the password type based on user selection and generate the corresponding password. <br>
•	List Shuffling: Used to randomly shuffle the password characters for added security. <br>
•	Global Variables: For storing the user's selected password type, length, and the generated password. <br>
•	Functions: Modular design with functions for taking user input, displaying instructions, and generating passwords. <br>
### Instructions for Use
1.	Run the program: When prompted, you can choose between generating a password, reading the instructions, or exiting the app. <br>
2.	Password Generation: Select the length (8-16 characters) and the type of password (Numbers, Letters, Symbols, or combinations). <br>
3.	Instructions: View detailed guidance on how different types of passwords affect security. <br>
4.	Exit: Choose to exit the program at any time. <br>
### Security Tips
•	Use a combination of numbers, letters, and symbols for a stronger password. <br>
•	Avoid common patterns like "123456" or "password." <br>
•	Aim for longer passwords (12-16 characters) for increased security. <br>
•	Consider using a password manager to securely store your passwords. <br>
